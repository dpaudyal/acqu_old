##                *** Acqu++ <-> Root ***
## Online/Offline Analysis of Sub-Atomic Physics Experimental Data 
##
## Parameter File: AnalysisMC.dat (specified in A2.Sim)
## Setup basic parameters of analysis to be used
## This one sets up a full analysis of data files generated by the
## GEANT-3 based Monte Carlo model of the CB and TAPS
##

## Apparatus setup....no polarisation in MC model
##              Name            Class           Setup file
Apparatus:      TAGG     	TA2Tagger   	Tagger_855_MC.dat
Apparatus:      CB              TA2CrystalBall  CB_2010_MC.dat
# gh: comment TAPS out for now.  Causes crashes, needs to be investigated!
